INSTRUCTIONS:
The user has requested to initialize AI Configurations, Project Specifications, Workflows, Guardrails, and Rules for their project.
Please autonomously create the following folders and files with intelligently generated boilerplate rules according to the context provided:

### Claude Code
📚 **Official Documentation:**
- Memory & CLAUDE.md: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/memory
- Settings & Permissions: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/settings
- Custom Slash Commands: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands

Refer to the documentation above for the correct file format, structure, and best practices. Generate the following configuration files for Claude Code. Each file must be comprehensive, production-grade, and tailored to the project context below.

#### 1. `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (Root — Master Guide)
This is the most critical file. It is loaded at the start of every Claude Code session. Generate it with the following sections:
- **Project Overview**: A concise 2-3 line summary of what the project does, its purpose, and target audience.
- **Tech Stack**: Explicitly list all languages, frameworks, runtimes, package managers, and key libraries. Be specific (e.g., "Node.js 20+", "React 18 with TypeScript 5.x").
- **Architecture & Directory Structure**: Map out key directories and their responsibilities. Explain the separation of concerns (e.g., `src/api/` handles REST endpoints, `src/models/` defines database schemas).
- **Development Commands**: List all essential commands for building, running, testing, linting, and deploying the project.
- **Coding Conventions & Constraints**: Define naming conventions, file organization patterns, import ordering, error handling strategies, and any "never do this" rules.
- **Critical Rules**: Use `**IMPORTANT**` markers for rules that must never be violated (e.g., "Never commit secrets", "Always use parameterized queries").
- Keep it under 200 lines. Use `@` imports to reference detailed docs if needed.

#### 2. `.claude/rules/format.md` (Code Formatting Rules)
Write highly detailed, enforceable formatting rules. Include:
- Indentation style and size (tabs vs spaces, width).
- Naming conventions for variables, functions, classes, constants, files, and directories.
- Import/export ordering and grouping rules.
- Maximum line length and wrapping preferences.
- Comment style requirements (JSDoc, inline, block).
- Language-specific conventions (e.g., TypeScript strict mode, Python PEP8).
- Framework-specific patterns (e.g., React component structure, Express middleware ordering).
- Example code snippets showing the "gold standard" format.

#### 3. `.claude/rules/testing.md` (Testing Guidelines)
Write comprehensive testing rules and standards:
- Recommended test framework and assertion library (e.g., Vitest, Jest, pytest).
- Test file naming conventions and directory structure (e.g., `__tests__/`, `*.test.ts`).
- Required test coverage thresholds and what must be tested.
- Unit test patterns: setup/teardown, mocking strategies, fixture usage.
- Integration and E2E test guidelines if applicable.
- Example test structure showing a well-written test case.

#### 4. `.claude/rules/security.md` (Security Guardrails)
Write security-focused rules the agent must always follow:
- Input validation and sanitization requirements.
- Authentication and authorization patterns.
- Secrets management (never hardcode, use environment variables).
- Dependency security (audit, pinning, update strategy).
- Common vulnerability prevention (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF).
- File system and network access restrictions.

#### 5. `.claude/commands/review.md` (Slash Command)
Create a reusable `/review` slash command that instructs the agent to:
- Analyze the current changeset or staged files for bugs, security issues, and style violations.
- Check for proper error handling and edge cases.
- Verify test coverage for new or modified code.
- Output a structured review summary with severity levels.

#### 6. `.claude/commands/docs.md` (Slash Command)
Create a reusable `/docs` slash command that instructs the agent to:
- Scan the project for undocumented or poorly documented public APIs.
- Generate or update inline documentation (JSDoc, docstrings, etc.).
- Update the README.md if structural changes are detected.

#### 7. `.claude/skills/debug.md` (Skill Definition)
Create a debugging skill template with:
- A YAML frontmatter containing `name` and `description`.
- Step-by-step instructions for systematic debugging: reproduce → isolate → diagnose → fix → verify.
- Guidelines on reading stack traces, using logging, and writing regression tests.

#### 8. `settings.local.json` (Permissions)
Create a standard permissions configuration with:
- An `"allow"` array listing safe operations (e.g., read files, run tests, lint).
- A `"deny"` array listing dangerous operations (e.g., delete files outside project, install global packages, access network without approval).

Use your tools to write these files into the workspace now.
Delete BEDROCK.md file after you are done.
